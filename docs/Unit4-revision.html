      <h2>Structure of Internet</h2>
      <h3>WAN vs LAN</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>WAN is over larger geographical area</li>
        <li>WANs use 3rd party equipment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Components of a URL</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Protocol – Examples are http:// or https://</li>
        <li>Domain name – Examples are theimportanceofhomework.co.uk</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Top Level Domain (TLD) is “.uk”</li>
        </ul>
        <li>/homework/sheet5.html is the resource required from the server</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Domain Name Service</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Associates domain names with IP addresses</li>
        <li>
          DNS Servers are hierarchical, root DNS servers responsible for serving
          the definitive values.
        </li>
        <li>
          Internet Registry – Organisation that controls allocation of domains
          to IP addresses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>WWW vs Internet</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet describes connections between computers</li>
        <li>Internet covers specific protocols (TCP/IP)</li>
        <li>
          WWW refers to the set of hyperlinked documents, accessed using the
          HTTP/HTTPS protocols over the Internet
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Topologies, Bus Vs Star</h3>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>

      <h3>Wireless Networks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>NIC – Network Interface Card</li>
        <li>WAP – Wireless Access Point</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Internet Communication</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Circuit Switching – Creating a channel between two endpoints that
          endures during transaction (phone call)
        </li>
        <li>
          Packet Switching – Data is broken into small pieces and sent via many
          different routes, reassembled upon reception.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protocols – A set of rules for data communication, they must be
          standardised across devices for communications to work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Layers</h3>
      <h4>Application Layer</h4>
      Defines the set of standards used to communicate across the internet.
      Examples:
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP/HTTPS – Web Browsing, S = secure = encryption</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <ul>
          <li>SMTP – Simple Mail Transfer Protocol – sending emails</li>
          <li>POP3 – Downloading emails, deleted from server</li>
          <li>IMAP – Reading emails, persisted on the server</li>
        </ul>
        <li>FTP – File transfer Protocol</li>
        <li>SSH – Secure Shell</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Transport Layer</h4>
      <p>
        Splits data into packets, numbers them sequentially. Adds a port number
        to identity the destination service. TCP/IP – Transmission Control
        Protocol
      </p>

      <h4>Internet Layer</h4>
      Give packets the address of the source and destination
      <ul>
        <li>
          IPv4 – 32-bit number, 4 decimal numbers from 0-255 separated by ‘.’
        </li>
        <li>
          IPv6 – 128-bit number, 8 hexadecimal numbers from 0000 - FFFF,
          separated by ‘:’
        </li>
      </ul>
      Routing tables used to instruct the next hop as packet travels across the
      internet.

      <h4>Link Layer</h4>
      <p>
        Operates the physical connection between any given set of two devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every device has a MAC address – 6 hexadecimal numbers from 00 – FF,
        separated by ‘:’ Devices
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Switch – Can route packets within a private IP network, based on the
          MAC address
        </li>
        <li>
          Router – Can route packets between distinct IP networks (for example
          between a private LAN and the public internet)
        </li>
        <li>
          Gateway – Can route packets between networks that use distinct
          protocol stacks (for example between the mobile phone network and the
          internet).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Network Threats</h2>
      <h3>Threats</h3>

        <li>Malware – Malicious Software</li>
        <ul>
          <li>

            opened
          </li>
          <li>Worm – Standalone program that can run and propagate itself</li>
          <li>
            Trojan Horse – Malware hidden inside an apparently desirable
            payload, such as a free game/free software (pirated software is a
            haven for these)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Phishing – Sending emails/text messages with links to malicious sites
          to either
